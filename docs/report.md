# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model
Here is an entity-relation-diagram that illustrated _Chirp!_'s domain model.
![Data model as an ER-diagram.](./images/domain_model.png)

Each Cheep stores its id, some text, a timestamp that denotes when it was posted, and its author's id.

Each Author (AspNetUser) stores their id, username, email, password hash, whether they have two-factor-authentication enables, aswell the above mentioned. Author's can also follow each other in a many-to-many relation.

The AspNetUser, AspNetUserTokens, and AspNetUserLogins comes from ASP.NET Core Identity that _Chirp!_ uses to manage its users (i.e. Authors). In reality, each AspNetUser also stores additional attributes that are not used directly by _Chirp!_. These are normalized username and email, concurrency and sercurity stamps (used for e.g. password-resetting), phone number (_Chirp!_ doesn't collect phone numbers), lockout information, and an access failure count.
The AspNetUserTokens stores tokens such as two-factor-authentication keys and recovery codes, and AspNetUserLogins stores third-party login provider information, e.g. Github OAuth.
